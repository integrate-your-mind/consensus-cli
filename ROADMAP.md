# Roadmap

Near-term goals:
- Improve session-to-process matching with PID metadata when available.
- Add compact mini-map and grouping controls in the UI.
- Add basic performance profiling and render budget notes.
- Multi-device aggregation: optional cloud relay for agents across machines with a unified timeline.
