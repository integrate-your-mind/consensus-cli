# 002 - Package name

## Problem
We need a public npm name for npx installation.

## Options
- consensus (taken)
- consensus-cli
- codex-consensus

## Decision
consensus-cli.

## Tradeoffs
- Not as short as consensus, but still clear and marketable.

## Revisit
If the consensus name becomes available, consider a rename with migration notes.
