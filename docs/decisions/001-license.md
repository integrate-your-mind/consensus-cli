# 001 - License choice

## Problem
Pick a license that is permissive and supports commercial adoption.

## Options
- MIT
- Apache-2.0
- GPLv3

## Decision
MIT.

## Tradeoffs
- MIT is permissive and simple, but has no explicit patent grant.

## Revisit
If patent protection becomes a priority, consider Apache-2.0.
