# Problem and wedge

## Problem statement
Developers running multiple Codex sessions lose visibility into what each agent
is doing. They jump between terminals, logs, and window titles to rebuild
context, which costs time and causes errors.

## Wedge
A local-only, one-command dashboard that shows live agent activity and status.

## Proof loop
- Measure time to first view (install to first map render).
- Track repeated use and session duration.
- Ship fixes within 24-48 hours after reported breakage.

## Proof metrics (initial)
- Time to first success.
- Weekly active users.
- Average number of active agents shown per session.
- Error rate from scans.
